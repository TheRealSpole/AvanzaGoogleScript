# AvanzaGoogleScript

AvanzaGoogleScript is a script to fetch Fund and Stock data from Swedish bank Avanza and use it in a Google Sheet.

Not my script from the beginning but a friend found it on the Internet. Never found the real source for it.

GS AZ-fuldata v1.0.2 -25 Juli 2018-

As some might still find it useful I updated it a bit to work with Avanzas latest changes to the website.
